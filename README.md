## What I learned from Learn the fundamentals of a good developer mindset in 15 minutes

“Difficult to make even small changes”

In general, there are several tasks that a software developer performs on an almost daily basis, but there are also many problems that he faces that can affect his performance in general. The results do not necessarily appear immediately, but rather their effects appear over time. Therefore,Many behaviors and habits can be avoided. Problems and win the programmer mentality:

1. Conceiving The Purpose of Software
   >Understanding the purpose of the applications will avoid the developer from writing bad apps, and what it means is a difficult program to use that will not benefit people, and this is what must be avoided, in addition to determining how to solve the problem and providing assistance through the applications simply if possible.

2. The Goals of Software Design
   >We should take into our perspective that the created software must be easy to use by everyone and useful, and this will guarantee a longer life, but if the system is designed in a bad way, this will lead to a shorter life.

3. (Mis)understanding
   >Good developers focus on understanding what they are doing this going to give them simple and great software.
    >Bad developers don't know what they are doing and this is what makes their products bad and short lifetime
4. Simplicity
    >The Complexity and complicated commits dose not related to the intelligence exactly the contrary it means you failed in your mission to make simple code and you didn't take in your mind the newest people in your code.
    So, you have and keep in your mind what I want from the people once they get into my code to be confused or happy?
5. Complexity
    > Some too many developers become victims because they lack knowledge about the project, they are building the goal of it what is necessary and what isn't which leads them to complexity out of control.
    >>To avoid this mess, we have to get full knowledge about the project what service will provide, and what problem going to solve, and once the developer gets the full picture about what he going to do this will let him decide what is necessary updates should be in
that's how he can control the complexity of the previous planning
6. Maintenance
    >These important steps are usually ignored by many developers they are focusing on fast shipping and quick coding without taking the future updates in the code or the upcoming implementation of changes.
    >>So, to be away from this nightmare if we start with clear planning and organizing workflow, we will achieve the goal which is: *It is more important to reduce the effort of maintenance than it is to reduce the effort of implementation*.

7. Consistency
    >We have to be more logical and simpler to make our code more understandable and consistently throw valuable names and one flow this will make the code easy to read.
8. Prioritizing
    >Once you know what is important in the current time for your project and which one is more valuable and takes less effort you reach the point of prioritizing.
    because you don't want to lose your time and effort for changes that will bring little value.
9. Solving Problems
    >We have more than one step to solve problems they are like the flowing:
    >
    > 1. Understanding the problem:
        >
            >>1. Knowing what you are looking for.
            >>
            >>2. Try to explain it in short sentences or to someone else.
        >
    > 2. Take some time before doing anything to analyze and process all the detail.
    > 3. Divide what you are trying to deal with and don't deal with it in one peace.
    >
10. Good enough is fine
    >Developers usually when they start planning for a new project are drowning in very deep details of their fancy project and forget what this behavior will cost them
    from Time, more away from the main goal of the project, more unexpected bugs, missing deadlines, and losing control of the complexity, No one wants to be in this situation,
    >>Rather than starting Big and getting lost, Start clearer and more focused on the main functionality then start to grow step by step.
11. Predictions
    >
12. Assumptions
    > Trying to solve future problems and predict they won't lead will only lead us to chaos, Problems that will slow down the designed software, and most of the issues you are trying to solve before they occur will force you to write many redundant codes that will increase the difficulty of maintenance and eliminate clarity and control the complexity.
13. Stop Reinventing
    >Don't waste your time reinventing existing technology when it's already delivered and existed,
        But there are some conditions you can break this rule:
        >
        > - You need something that doesn’t exist yet
        > - All of the existing techs are bad technologies or incapable of handling your needs
        > - The existing tech aren’t being properly maintained

14. Resistance
    >Changes aren't necessary unless they are core functionality and the mean goal of the software otherwise, they want to be in the app.
15. Automation
    >Invest your time by avoiding repetitive tasks by automating them if they can be automated.
16. Code measurement
    >The number of code lines doesn't mean correctly the quality of the software because it's maybe can be done with a few lines of code or not.
    So, remember that the simpler and more legible the script will be better.
17. Productivity
    >Focus on making the written code light instead of thinking about writing more and increasing complexity
18. Testing
    >Adding Error Handling and testing the code will save time and efforts that will be spent on figuring out where are the issues,
    To be away from all of that you have to test your code and avoid and provide a clear error handler.
19. (Under)Estimation
    >Don't estimate project time as a whole because developers' estimation sucks,
    You can solve this by breaking the project into small tasks and estimating each of them separately
20. Running Away From Rewriting
    > Rewriting your code isn't the real solution in most cases,
    Maybe there are some times you have to take this hard decision but in most cases, Refactoring  will be the first option
21. Documentation and Commenting
    >
    > - Committing mission to explain Why Not What you did in your project, so it must be clear and simple as possible.
    > - documentation's like a map of your project that allows all the developers to understand the software as a whole and this will make fewer errors and conflicts.
    >
22. Picking Technologies (Tools, Libraries, etc.)
    >Your freedom is as much as your dependence on external technologies in your project
    Technology from external sources must be used with caution to avoid falling into pivotal problems that may affect the progress and progress of the project as a whole.
    If it is necessary to use external technologies, There are a few factors you should consider before you start using some technology:
    >
    >- Is there active development behind it?
    >- Will it continue to be maintained?
    >- How easy is it to switch away from?
    >- What does the community say about it?
    >
    >Based on these answers, you can decide whether you can use this technology or not .

23. Self-Development
    >Being a developer means you have to be motivated to develop yourself with the right tech even with small improvements this will make a difference.
24. Don’t be a hero
    >Don't be in a petrified mind be yourself and make sure that it's normal to make mistakes.
    Sometimes things don't work out for you so don't hesitate to ask for help.
25. Don’t Ask Questions… Ask For Help
    > when you want to implement anything tey by your own, If you didn't know how to do it search for answers and work on them to fit into your code, But don't forget to ask for advice after trying all the above so you can share your thoughts and this will allow the advisor provide clear advice.
